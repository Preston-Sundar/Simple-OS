# Poop-Operating System
Creating a simple OS from scratch. 


## Goal
Learn how operating systems work by implementing one. The end result should support TCP connections, Support graphics and visualizations, and have memory and thread management.

## Bootloader
I have not implemented a bootloader, and instead untilize GNU GRUB to load my kernel.
